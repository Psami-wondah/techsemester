# Backend - Techsemester Suggestions API

### Install Dependencies

1. **Python 3.7** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

2. **Virtual Environment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the base directory and running:

Django 3.2 is being used to accomodate deployment on render

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Server

From within the base directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

## Testing

To deploy the tests, run

```bash
python3 manage.py test
```
